# rfid-laser
control acces for a laser machine in a makerspace.
There original 40w laser was replaced by a longer 60w laser tube,so a MFD box was build to accomodate it.I put the electronics inside this box whith aluminium shield to protect from the electrostatics fields of the laser tube,but this is not enought and sometimes it fails.So it is better to put this device elsewere. 
RFIDLASE.PNG  is the shematic
RfidLaserControl_v2.ino is the arduino program
